# Tic Tac Toe

An example of a command-line game of Tic Tac Toe written in Java.

The point is to exhibit the best practice of using single-purpose modular methods for each task of the program, keep the `main` method simple and focused on the core logic, use `javadoc` comments to describe the class as a whole and each individual method, and to show how two-dimensional arrays can be used to manipulate row/column type data.

Two methods are left intentionally undone, for you to complete: `isWin` and `isBoardFull`.
